# Access Control Mechanisms in Solidity
Access control is crucial in smart contract development for ensuring that only authorized parties can execute specific functions. In this lesson, you'll learn how to implement access control in your smart contracts using Solidity’s features and standard libraries.

## Key Concepts
1. Ownable Contracts:
    - Commonly used to manage ownership of a contract.
Provided by OpenZeppelin’s library for easy implementation.
2. Role-Based Access Control:
    - Allows multiple roles with specific permissions.
    - Useful for decentralized applications with different stakeholders.
